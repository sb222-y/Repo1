I have made a simple calculator app in this which performs differents arithmetic operations like addition,substraction,division,multiplications etc. I have used HTML,CSS language in this and also some java script has been used in this.In this I have assigned different fonts and background colors to tis calculator so that how many operations can be performed and I can easily identify the operatios that are being performed.
